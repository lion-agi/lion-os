       "Certainly! Here are some FastAPI coding question ideas that you can use to evaluate the skills of software engineers:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Basic CRUD Operations:**\n",
       "   - Implement a simple FastAPI application that performs CRUD operations on a resource, such as a \"Book\" or \"User\". Ensure the use of appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Dependency Injection:**\n",
       "   - Demonstrate how to use FastAPI's dependency injection system to manage database connections or authentication mechanisms.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Path and Query Parameters:**\n",
       "   - Create an endpoint that accepts both path and query parameters. For example, a search endpoint that filters results based on query parameters.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Data Validation with Pydantic:**\n",
       "   - Use Pydantic models to validate incoming request data. Create a model with various field types and constraints, and demonstrate how FastAPI handles validation errors.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Asynchronous Programming:**\n",
       "   - Write an asynchronous endpoint that performs a time-consuming task, such as fetching data from an external API or performing a complex calculation.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Middleware Implementation:**\n",
       "   - Implement a custom middleware in FastAPI that logs request and response details or measures the time taken to process a request.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Error Handling:**\n",
       "   - Demonstrate how to handle exceptions globally in a FastAPI application and return custom error messages or status codes.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **JWT Authentication:**\n",
       "   - Implement JWT-based authentication in a FastAPI application. Create endpoints for user login and protected routes that require a valid token.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **WebSocket Communication:**\n",
       "   - Set up a WebSocket endpoint in FastAPI for real-time communication, such as a simple chat application.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Background Tasks:**\n",
       "    - Use FastAPI's background tasks feature to offload non-blocking operations, such as sending an email after a user registers.\n",
       "\n",
       "These questions can help assess a candidate's understanding of FastAPI's features and their ability to apply them in practical scenarios."

The TTL duration can be configured based on how frequently the data changes and the application\\'s performance requirements.\\n\\n2. **Event-Triggered Invalidation:**\\n   - Identify key events that require invalidation of the cache, such as updates, deletions, or insertions in the database.\\n   - Implement listeners or hooks in the application that detect these events. For instance, if your application uses an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy), you can use event listeners to trigger cache invalidation whenever a change to the data occurs.\\n\\n3. **Selective Invalidation:**\\n   - Ensure that cache invalidation is granular enough to avoid unnecessary invalidation of unrelated data.

This connection is closed gracefully during shutdown.\\n- **Cached Responses**: The `get_data` endpoint attempts to retrieve data from Redis using a generated cache key. If the data is cached, it is returned directly; if not, the data is \"fetched\" (simulated here) and then cached before returning.\\n- **TTL Management**: The `ex` parameter in the `redis.set` method specifies the Time To Live (TTL) for each cached item, automatically removing it after the specified time to manage memory usage efficiently.\\n\\nAdapting this pattern to your own application allows frequently requested data to be served from cache, significantly improving response times and reducing load on your database or other backing services.'),\n",

Validate that the async functions properly handle responses and exceptions asynchronously.', context='External API interactions currently use blocking requests, impacting the responsiveness and throughput of the application.', response='To transform the external API calls within your endpoints to utilize asynchronous requests with `aiohttp` or `httpx`, you\\'ll need to follow these general steps:\\n\\n1. **Install aiohttp or httpx**: First, ensure that you have the `aiohttp` or `httpx` library installed in your project. You can install it using pip:\\n    ```bash\\n    pip install aiohttp\\n    # or\\n    pip install httpx\\n    ```\\n\\n2. **Update Import Statements**: Replace imports for any synchronous HTTP libraries like `requests` with imports for `aiohttp` or `httpx`.\\n\\n3. **Convert Blocking Calls to Async**: Rewrite the synchronous API request code to use asyncio-friendly functions from `aiohttp` or `httpx`.\\n\\n4. **Ensure Endpoint Functions are Asynchronous**: Make sure your endpoint functions are declared as `async`.\\n\\nHere is an example demonstrating the transformation using `httpx`, which is quite developer-friendly and maintains compatibility with synchronous API formats:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\\n# If using aiohttp, import ClientSession\\nimport httpx\\n\\napp = FastAPI()\\n\\n@app.get(\"/example\")\\nasync def async_example():\\n    # Using an httpx async client for the request\\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\\n        try:\\n            response = await client.get(\\'https://api.example.com/data\\')\\n            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad HTTP status codes\\n            data = response.json()\\n            return data\\n        except httpx.HTTPStatusError as exc:\\n            # Handle error of bad HTTP response\\n            return {\"error\": str(exc)}\\n        except httpx.RequestError as exc:\\n            # Handle network related issues\\n            return {\"error\": str(exc)}\\n\\n# If using aiohttp, you would instead manage ClientSession similarly:\\n# async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\\n#     async with session.get(\\'https://api.example.com/data\\') as response:\\n#         data = await response.json()\\n#         return data\\n```\\n\\n### Key Changes:\\n\\n- **AsyncClient**: When using `httpx`, create an instance of `AsyncClient` for making async requests. Use `await` for the requests and closing the client to ensure proper coroutine behavior.\\n\\n- **Error Handling**: Handle exceptions like `HTTPStatusError` and `RequestError` to manage both HTTP status and request-related errors.\\n\\n- **Endpoint Changes**: Ensure FastAPI endpoints are asynchronous by using `async def`. This allows you to leverage Python\\'s `asyncio` capabilities to improve the responsiveness and throughput of your application, especially under high-concurrency scenarios.\\n\\nFollowing this pattern will help refactor your FastAPI application to handle external API interactions asynchronously, minimizing blocking operations and enhancing performance.'),\n",

Common operations include opening files, reading from files, writing to files, or closing files.\\n\\n2. **Analyze Current Implementation:**\\n   - Evaluate the current implementation to understand how file data is being read and processed. Pay attention to whether these operations are within the critical path of your application where performance bottlenecks could occur.\\n\\n3. **Modify Operations to Use `aiofiles`:**\\n   - For each synchronous file operation identified, replace it with the equivalent asynchronous operations using `aiofiles`. This includes:\\n     - Asynchronously opening files using `aiofiles.open`.\\n     - Performing read and write operations using methods like `await f.read()` and `await f.write(data)`.\\n     - Closing the files automatically with an `async with` context manager or explicitly using `await f.close()` if necessary.\\n\\n4. **Test the Asynchronous File Operations:**\\n   - Once modifications are in place, conduct thorough testing. Ensure that file operations no longer block the event loop and the application behaves as expected under typical and peak loads.\\n\\nBelow is an example code snippet demonstrating how to convert synchronous file reading to asynchronous:\\n\\n**Synchronous Example:**\\n\\n```python\\ndef read_file_sync(file_path):\\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\\n        content = file.read()\\n    return content\\n```\\n\\n**Asynchronous Conversion:**\\n\\n```python\\nimport aiofiles\\n\\nasync def read_file_async(file_path):\\n    async with aiofiles.open(file_path, 'r') as file:\\n        content = await file.read()\\n    return content\\n```\\n\\nBy following these steps and using `aiofiles`, you ensure that file operations within your application are optimized for non-blocking execution, improving overall application responsiveness and scalability.\")]"

       "\n",
       "- **Minimal Error Information**: Error messages for authentication should not indicate whether the username or password was incorrect, just that credentials are invalid. This prevents attackers from guessing login information.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Clear HTTP Status Codes**: Use appropriate HTTP status codes like 401 for unauthorized access to indicate to the client the nature of the issue without exposing sensitive information.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Exception Handling**: Use exception handling to manage JWT errors and ensure the application provides consistent feedback without crashing.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Security Headers**: Consider adding security headers like `WWW-Authenticate` to guide clients on how to proceed with authentication when an error occurs.\n",

       "To implement a cache invalidation strategy that ensures the application serves up-to-date data while balancing the benefits of caching, consider the following steps:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Time-Based Expiration:**\n",
       "   - Set a time-to-live (TTL) for cached data. This approach ensures data is regularly refreshed after a specific interval, balancing freshness with performance. The TTL duration can be configured based on how frequently the data changes and the application's performance requirements.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Event-Triggered Invalidation:**\n",
       "   - Identify key events that require invalidation of the cache, such as updates, deletions, or insertions in the database.\n",
       "   - Implement listeners or hooks in the application that detect these events. For instance, if your application uses an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy), you can use event listeners to trigger cache invalidation whenever a change to the data occurs.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Selective Invalidation:**\n",
       "   - Ensure that cache invalidation is granular enough to avoid unnecessary invalidation of unrelated data. For instance, if a user-related data entry changes, only invalidate the cache for the affected user and not the entire dataset.\n",
       "   - Use efficient cache key patterns that allow for targeted invalidation based on data dependencies.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Cache Warming:**\n",
       "   - After invalidating the cache, consider pre-loading or \"warming\" the cache with fresh data for frequently accessed entries to maintain responsive performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Monitoring and Logging:**\n",
       "   - Continuously monitor cache performance and miss rates. Logging cache invalidation events and their triggers can help fine-tune strategies for optimal balance between data freshness and performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Utilize External Cache Systems:**\n",
       "   - Consider using external distributed cache systems like Redis or Memcached, which offer advanced features for cache management, including expiration times and support for large-scale applications.\n",

       "- **Logging**: Invalid token accesses due to token errors or expiry are logged for auditing purposes.\n",

       "To optimize a FastAPI application and handle performance issues during peak usage, you can follow these steps:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Utilize Asynchronous Capabilities**:\n",
       "   - Ensure that all I/O-bound operations are using asynchronous functions (`async def`) to avoid blocking the event loop. This includes database queries, external API calls, and file operations.\n",
       "   - Replace synchronous libraries with asynchronous counterparts wherever possible (e.g., use `httpx` instead of `requests` for HTTP calls).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Efficient Dependency Management**:\n",
       "   - Use FastAPI's dependency injection system to manage and optimize shared resources. For example, use a database connection pool to reuse connections and reduce management overhead.\n",
       "   - Properly scope dependencies to avoid unnecessary initialization. For singleton resources, use a `Depends` decorator with `cache` enabled.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Middleware Optimization**:\n",
       "   - Analyze and streamline middleware layers to reduce processing time. Consider removing or optimizing any heavy processing middlewares.\n",
       "   - Implement logging and monitoring middlewares to keep track of performance metrics and potential bottlenecks.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Integrate Caching**:\n",
       "   - Use caching to store frequent static responses or expensive computation results. Implement caching at both local levels (in-memory caching) and distributed levels (like Redis).\n",
       "   - Set appropriate cache expiration times to ensure data consistency and freshness.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Utilize Application Profiling and Monitoring**:\n",
       "   - Profile the application to identify slow components or functions using tools like `cProfile` or `py-spy`.\n",
       "   - Integrate monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana to keep track of application performance metrics and receive alerts on threshold breaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Scale with ASGI Servers**:\n",
       "   - Deploy FastAPI app using an ASGI server such as Uvicorn or Daphne that supports asynchronous work efficiently.\n",
       "   - Implement load balancing and horizontally scale the application across multiple instances to handle increased traffic during peak usage.\n",
       "\n",
       "By following these optimization steps and leveraging FastAPI's asynchronous strengths, you can significantly enhance the application's performance, ensuring smooth operation even under high load conditions."

       "- **Error Handling**: Handle exceptions like `HTTPStatusError` and `RequestError` to manage both HTTP status and request-related errors.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Endpoint Changes**: Ensure FastAPI endpoints are asynchronous by using `async def`. This allows you to leverage Python's `asyncio` capabilities to improve the responsiveness and throughput of your application, especially under high-concurrency scenarios.\n",
       "\n",
       "Following this pattern will help refactor your FastAPI application to handle external API interactions asynchronously, minimizing blocking operations and enhancing performance."

       "\n",
       "1. **Identify Synchronous File I/O Operations:**\n",
       "   - Review the codebase to locate any instances where synchronous file operations occur. Common operations include opening files, reading from files, writing to files, or closing files.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Analyze Current Implementation:**\n",
       "   - Evaluate the current implementation to understand how file data is being read and processed. Pay attention to whether these operations are within the critical path of your application where performance bottlenecks could occur.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Modify Operations to Use `aiofiles`:**\n",
       "   - For each synchronous file operation identified, replace it with the equivalent asynchronous operations using `aiofiles`. This includes:\n",
       "     - Asynchronously opening files using `aiofiles.open`.\n",
       "     - Performing read and write operations using methods like `await f.read()` and `await f.write(data)`.\n",
       "     - Closing the files automatically with an `async with` context manager or explicitly using `await f.close()` if necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Test the Asynchronous File Operations:**\n",
       "   - Once modifications are in place, conduct thorough testing. Ensure that file operations no longer block the event loop and the application behaves as expected under typical and peak loads.\n",
       "\n",
       "Below is an example code snippet demonstrating how to convert synchronous file reading to asynchronous:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Synchronous Example:**\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def read_file_sync(file_path):\n",

       "**Asynchronous Conversion:**\n",
