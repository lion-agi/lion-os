       "Certainly! Here are some FastAPI coding questions that can help evaluate a candidate's understanding and skills:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Basic Endpoint Creation:**\n",
       "   - Write a simple FastAPI endpoint that returns a JSON response with a greeting message. How would you test this endpoint?\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Path and Query Parameters:**\n",
       "   - Create an endpoint that accepts a user's name as a path parameter and age as a query parameter, then returns a personalized greeting message.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Data Validation with Pydantic:**\n",
       "   - Define a Pydantic model for a user profile with fields like `name`, `email`, and `age`. Create an endpoint to accept and validate this data.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Dependency Injection:**\n",
       "   - Explain how dependency injection works in FastAPI. Create an example where a database connection is injected into an endpoint.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Asynchronous Programming:**\n",
       "   - Demonstrate how to create an asynchronous endpoint in FastAPI. What are the benefits of using async endpoints?\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Handling HTTP Methods:**\n",
       "   - Implement a FastAPI application with endpoints to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for a simple resource like a \"task\".\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Error Handling:**\n",
       "   - How can you handle errors in FastAPI? Write an example of custom error handling for a 404 error.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Middleware:**\n",

       "\n",
       "9. **Authentication and Authorization:**\n",
       "   - Describe how you would implement JWT-based authentication in a FastAPI application. Provide a basic example.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Background Tasks:**\n",
       "    - Explain the use of background tasks in FastAPI. Write an endpoint that triggers a background task to send an email after a user registers.\n",
       "\n",
       "11. **WebSockets:**\n",
       "    - How can you implement WebSocket communication in FastAPI? Provide a simple example of a WebSocket endpoint.\n",

       "    - Describe how you would write tests for a FastAPI application. Write a test case for an endpoint using `pytest`.\n",
       "\n",
       "13. **CORS Configuration:**\n",
       "    - Explain how to configure CORS in a FastAPI application. Why is CORS important?\n",
       "\n",
       "14. **File Uploads:**\n",
       "    - Create an endpoint that allows users to upload a file. How would you handle and store the uploaded file?\n",
       "\n",
       "15. **API Documentation:**\n",
       "    - How does FastAPI automatically generate API documentation? What are the benefits of this feature?\n",

Use tools like `curl` or Postman to test the token authentication.\\n   ```bash\\n   # Retrieve an access token\\n   curl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/token\" -d \"username=user&password=password\"\\n\\n   # Access a protected route\\n   curl -X GET \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/me/\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer <your access token>\"\\n   ```\\n\\nThis setup provides a basic authentication system with user roles using FastAPI, securing the endpoints appropriately. You can expand it with database integration and more robust security measures as needed.'),\n",

This will ensure that all book records conform to a specific structure and facilitate data validation.\\n\\n2. **Database Indexing**:\\n   - Ensure that your database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) has indexes on the `title` and `author` fields. Indexing these fields will significantly improve the performance of search queries, as it allows the database to quickly locate rows matching the search criteria.\\n\\n3. **Search Implementation**:\\n   - Implement the search functionality using SQLAlchemy or another ORM that integrates well with FastAPI. You\\'ll likely want to leverage `LIKE` statements or full-text search capabilities provided by your database to enable flexible matching. For instance, using PostgreSQL\\'s `to_tsvector` and `to_tsquery` functions can allow for advanced search options including fuzzy matching and ranking of results.\\n\\n4. **Caching Mechanism**:\\n   - To further decrease query response times, especially for frequently searched terms, implement a caching layer. Tools like Redis can be leveraged to store recent search results and return them quickly without querying the database each time.\\n\\n5. **FastAPI Endpoint**:\\n   - Create a FastAPI endpoint `/search` that accepts query parameters for `title` and `author`. Ensure it can handle both GET and POST requests, providing flexibility based on the size of query data.\\n   - Make sure to include query parameter validation and proper error handling to manage scenarios where no books are found or input parameters are invalid.\\n\\n6. **Testing and Optimization**:\\n   - After implementing the search functionality, conduct load testing to simulate multiple concurrent users and analyze the performance. Optimize any slow queries and adjust indexing strategies as necessary.\\n   - Monitor the application\\'s performance in production and iterate on the caching strategy, considering patterns like Time To Live (TTL) for cache invalidation to ensure data freshness.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simplified version of how you can define the endpoint in FastAPI:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Query\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nfrom typing import List, Optional\\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\\nfrom database import SessionLocal, engine, Base\\nfrom models import Book\\n\\napp = FastAPI()\\n\\nclass Book(Base):\\n    __tablename__ = \\'books\\'\\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\\n    title = Column(String, index=True)\\n    author = Column(String, index=True)\\n    # other fields...\\n\\nclass BookResponse(BaseModel):\\n    title: str\\n    author: str\\n    # other fields...\\n\\n@app.get(\"/search\", response_model=List[BookResponse])\\nasync def search_books(title: Optional[str] = Query(None), author: Optional[str] = Query(None), db: Session = SessionLocal()):\\n    query = db.query(Book)\\n    if title:\\n        query = query.filter(Book.title.ilike(f\"%{title}%\"))\\n    if author:\\n        query = query.filter(Book.author.ilike(f\"%{author}%\"))\\n    return query.all()\\n```\\n\\nThis example assumes you have a setup for SQLAlchemy and a database connection. Adjust the ORM calls to fit the specifics of your setup, including database configurations and model declarations.'),\n",
